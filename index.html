<div class="home">

I am a physicist turned structural biologist. I try to understand the limitations of simplified models in molecular biology and why what's true for <i>E. coli</i> is not necessarily true for an elephant.

<br />
<br />

I interact with the environment using MX, EM, SAXS, and AI. Currently, a big data dweller, I don't do much experimental work anymore. Staff member at <a href="https://www.embl.org/sites/hamburg/">EMBL Hamburg</a>.
